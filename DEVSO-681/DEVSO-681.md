# SPIKE: Investigate creating a CIS L2 Amazon Linux AMI

# Requirement
We need to understand what is/isn't possible when generating a CIS L2 AMI Research what playbooks are already available, the level of modification required, what they do and any risks involved with using them.Will we need to create our own playbooks or use existing versions in the public domain.?Document your findings and recommendations - what has/hasn't been hardened. Initially we are using Amazon Linux 2 as a "discovery" to understand how much CIS Level 2 coverage is possible. If CIS L2 becomes a requirement we will need to implement for all OS's we produce.

Can you investigate what the L2 playbooks do, if there is any security issues we need to be aware of and what happens if you run the L1 & L2 playbooks
